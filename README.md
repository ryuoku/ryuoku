- 👋 Hi, I’m @ryuoku
- 👀 I’m interested in too many things. I'm primarily an artist. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Japanese and C+ coding.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on things that spark joy.
- 📫 How to reach me? You're gonna need luck - I am ADHD and hard to contact unless the stars align. Try my email at ozsomechick@gmail.com.
